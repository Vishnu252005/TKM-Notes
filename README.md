Hereâ€™s a more organized and structured version of your Flutter project README that includes step-by-step instructions for common issues and tasks related to keystore management, Google Play Console upload, and build troubleshooting:

---

# Nexia

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [Online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/): Tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Managing App Versions

To update the app version:
1. Open `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Change the version number in the `version:` field.
   - Example: `version: 1.0.0+1` to `version: 1.0.0+2` for incrementing the build number.

## Keystore Management

### Deleting an Existing Keystore Alias

If you need to delete an existing keystore alias:

```bash
keytool -delete -alias upload -keystore $env:USERPROFILE\upload-keystore.jks
```

### Creating a New Keystore

To create a new keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore $env:USERPROFILE\upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

### Checking Keystore Information

To check the details of your keystore, run the following command:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore android/app/upload-keystore.jks
```

This will display important information, such as the SHA1 and SHA256 fingerprints of your keystore.

## Google Play Console Upload & Signing

### Error: App Signed with Wrong Key

If you encounter the following error when uploading to Google Play Console:

```
Your Android App Bundle is signed with the wrong key. Ensure that your App Bundle is signed with the correct signing key and try again.
```

1. Verify that your keystore matches the one expected by Google Play.
2. If the keystore is correct but the error persists, remove the signing configuration from `build.gradle` temporarily by commenting out or removing the line:
   ```groovy
   signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
   ```

### Creating a New Release in Google Play Console

- If you still face issues, consider creating a new release in the Play Console or generate a new signing key.
- Then upload your APK or AAB.

## Troubleshooting Build Issues

### Error: `Execution failed for task ':app:signReleaseBundle'`

If you encounter this error when building a release bundle:

```
Failed to read key upload from store "C:\path\to\upload-keystore.jks": Cannot recover key
```

1. Verify that the keystore information is correct:
   - Check the `key.properties` file for the correct alias and password.
2. Double-check that the password in the `key.properties` file matches the one used when generating the keystore.

### Gradle Build Failure

If the build fails with an error like:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:signReleaseBundle'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.FinalizeBundleTask$BundleToolRunnable
```

#### Solution:
1. Ensure the `key.properties` file is correct with the right paths and credentials.
2. If the error persists, try updating or downgrading the Gradle version:
   - Update `gradle-wrapper.properties` to use Gradle version 7.5, build again, and observe the logs.
   - If errors still occur, revert to the previous working Gradle version.

## Drive Link Setup for Android Permissions

When sharing files using Google Drive links in your app, ensure the link format allows direct download by replacing the standard link with an exportable version:

- Example: Replace the Google Drive link to use `export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID`.

Also, ensure the necessary permissions are defined in `AndroidManifest.xml` to handle file downloads.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

By following this well-organized guide, you should be able to manage app signing, keystores, versioning, and troubleshoot any build errors effectively.
